Text Links Manager Addin for RadAsm

	A simple addin to finding an browsing added text links from RadAsm. If you added Note,Bug or ToDo links
in your sources(Asm and Inc only) you will easily find your link's places in your project. BTW, you may see 
your main Txt file to check the notes, as a bonus ;)
	In fact thinking to modify, delete, replace notes,todo etc. from addin dialog but the possible lines 
which not belongs to any links, is a problem w/o an ending point.

Motivation:

	I think frequently forgetting some notes to do or fix. I can look at .txt to find the added notes etc.
at first but how will i find them in project? Switching a link somewhere in source code to note in .txt 
and back to source code is easy by F2 & Ctrl+F2 pair. But if you first look a note in .txt and want to go
to link is not so easy. Yo must do a find for whole project for a sertain sentence, for example (TODO2:). 
Now this is easy.

How Works:

	You will add the links from, RadAsm->Project->Create Text Link menu, as usual, yourself. When you need
to browse this links, will go to RadAsm->Tools->Text Links Manager menu. This will open a dialog which has
a listview left side and a .txt preview right side. If tou added some links before, this links' names will
list in listview. If you double click an item, the related page and line will bring up. Now you may use
F2 and Ctrl+F2 pair to switch as usual, thats all folks :)

Installing Addin:

Put the dll in \Addins folder. Open Addin Manager and install. Or manually,

In RadASM.ini section [Addin] add,

x=TxtLnkMan.dll,y

Where x is next free number any y is the options
The addin has no options.
