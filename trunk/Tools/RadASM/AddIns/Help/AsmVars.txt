ASMVARS v1.00a, (c)2001 Jeremy Collake

This program is designed to scan assembly language projects
for unreferenced local and global variables. 

USAGE:

  ASMVARS file1 file2 file3 ... [@files.lst] [!datatypes.lst] [-v]

ASMVARS can be provided a list of files on the command line, or
can read a list of files from a list file (prefixed with '@'). All
files provided to ASMVARS are treated as a single project. Wildcards 
are not accepted. The -v switchs puts ASMVARS into verbose mode.

ASMVARS automatically includes files indicated by 'include xxx'
statements in the source code. Furthermore, ASMVARS automatically
picks up on STRUCT and UNION datatypes that are defined in the source
and also handles subsequent EQU's on those datatypes. However, if
you wish to manually specify datatypes then you can supply ASMVARS
with a datatypes list file by prefixing that filename with '!'.

Four passes are performed:
        1 = Scan for INCLUDED files and datatypes.
        2 = Scan for datatype EQUs.
        3 = Scan for local variables declarations, local variable 
            references, and for global variable declarations.
        4 = Scan for global variable references.
        
The return value is the number of unreferenced global and local variables
found.

Enjoy!
