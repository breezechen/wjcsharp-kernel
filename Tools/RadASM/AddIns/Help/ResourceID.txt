This addin auto exports resource id's to the file rsrc.xxx when any of the
resource scripts are updated. At the same time code properties are refreshed.
This means that code complete on resource id's will work immediatly after any
resource script is saved.
The export is done ONLY if the rsrc.xxx file exists in the projects root folder.

rsrc.xxx:
------------------------
Assembly	rsrc.inc
Hla		rsrc.hhf
C/C++		rsrc.h
bcet, fb	rsrc.bi
