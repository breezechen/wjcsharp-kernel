Provides a quick lookup of system error codes and their descriptions.
You can look for decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers (preceded by "0x"), and equate names.
The list of errors currently supported includes system errors (GetLastError API), Winsock errors (WSAEGetLastError API), and COM errors (as returned in EAX).

There are two versions (completely independent from each other):
    - WinErr.exe        Standalone version.
    - WinErr.dll      	AddIn version (see below).

The standalone version will store it's settings in WinErr.Ini, located at the same directory in wich WinErr.exe resides.

You can load the WinErr addin under the following IDEs:
    - AsmEdit, by Ewayne L. Wagner
    - Chrome (formerly known as MAsmEd), by Franck Charlet
    - QuickEditor, by Steve Hutchesson
    - RadAsm, by Ketil Olsen
    - WinAsm, by Antonis Kyprianou

Integration with AsmEdit:

Copy WinErr.dll to your AddIns folder, and add it to the Addins menu. The call procedure name is "AsmEditProc".
For a step-by-step explanation on how to do this, please refer to AsmEdit docs.
The settings will be saved in AddIns\WinErr.Ini.

Integration with Chrome (v1.0 and above):

Copy WinErr.dll to your AddIns folder, and enable it from the Addins Manager.
You can install it under a previous version by just using "Update addin" in the context menu at the Addins Manager and selecting the last version of the dll (Chrome should handle the rest).
The settings will be saved in AddIns\WinErr.Ini. 
NOTE: This addin will NOT work with the old MAsmEd IDE, although it's shown in the Addins Manager. Attempting to load WinErr under MAsmEd will cause a GPF.

Integration with QuickEditor:
(http://www.masmforum.com)

Copy WinErr.dll in your masm32 folder, then open the menu editor (Edit -> Edit Menus) and add the following entry under the [Tools] section:

    Windows Error Descriptions,\masm32\WinErr.dll

To integrate the standalone version, add this entry instead:

    Windows Error Descriptions,\masm32\WinErr.exe

The Addin version will store it's settings in WinErr.Ini.

Integration with RadAsm (v2.0.3.0 and above):
(http://radasm.visualassembler.com)

Copy WinErr.dll to your AddIns folder and install it using Addin Manager.
To do it manually, add the following to the [AddIns] section of RadASM.ini:

    n=WinErr.dll,x,1

Where "n" is the next available addin number, and "x" is the option (0 to disable, 1 to enable).
For earlier versions of RadAsm, the following entry must be added instead:

    n=WinErr.dll,x

The settings will be stored in AddIns\WinErr.Ini.
